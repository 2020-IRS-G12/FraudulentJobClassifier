## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT

Since the COVID-19 global pandemic hit in December 2019, its outbreak has dramatically impacted the world on every level. In Singapore, people have experienced changes in the job market, job postings fell by around 15 percent year-on-year since April 2020, and hiring growth rates have declined since February 2020. Unemployment is expected to spike to 5 percent or more. 

Under this situation, more and more companies post their job positions online, remote-working also becomes mainstream. On the other hand, job scams are on the rise as well. According to an annual Flewjob survey, nearly 20% of job seekers have been victim of a job scam (up from 13% in 2016).

In response to this new challenge in the COVID-19 pandemic, our team decided to build an intelligent pattern recognition system to help job seekers to avoid fraudulent job ads. This system can learn patterns from training data â€“ Employment Scam Aegean Dataset from the University of the Aegean(http://emscad.samos.aegean.gr/), and be able to predict potential fraudulent job ads.

We began by dealing with the unbalanced dataset, and utilize ensemble learning to learn patterns from structured data as well as unstructured data (Text) simultaneously. After that, a web-based user interface was implemented then the system becomes useable.
